To use the password generator, first click on the red "Generate Password" button. A prompt window will then ask how long you want your password to be (enter a number between 8-128). A set of dialogue boxes will then follow asking what types of characters you would like to include in your password; you can choose to accept or deny each character set as you see fit as long as you accept at least one. Your generated password will then appear on screen.
